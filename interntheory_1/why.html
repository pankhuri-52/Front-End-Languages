<h1>Because I am Batman</h1>
<br>
Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting
characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon, and vigilante allies
such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers;
rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective
skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large
assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the
Joker.

<h1>The One Man War On Crime</h1>
<br>
Although Batman now has a family of sorts comprised of Robin, Red Robin and
Nightwing, among others, his origin as a one-man war on crime is perhaps one of the
most endearing aspects of his character. If you've ever been a victim of a criminal, then
you'll be familiar with the sense of rageful injustice that comes hand in hand. Bruce
Wayne, as early as 8 years old, had suffered this injustice to such an extreme that he
chose to arm himself with every weapon possible and suit up to take back the streets,
one lowlife at a time.

<h1>The Bat Cave</h1>
<br>
It houses literally the entire Bat-legacy: from Batsuits to Batmobiles, as well as trophies
of victory and oh, who could forget, a giant T-Rex statue. In fact the Batcave is
conceptually similar to Bruce Wayne himself in many ways; where there once was a
dark, endless void deep beneath the surface, now resides the Batman. There are plenty
of physical and metaphorical barriers that he passes around himself and his secret
identity, but the Batcave is by far the most awesome.
